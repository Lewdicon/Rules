                    <li>No harassment, discrimination, or unacceptable behavior of any kind</li>
                    <li>Disagreements should be handled maturely through proper channels</li>

                    <h4>😡 Disrespect, Distasteful, Disgusting</h4>
                    <p>This behavior means being intentionally hurtful, offensive, or disruptive. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using slurs or hate speech (no bigotry or T.R.A.S.H allowed)</li>
                        <li>Intentionally misgendering someone based on their voice</li>
                        <li>Starting IRL political arguments or debates</li>
                        <li>Harassing or bullying others (this includes repeatedly attacking or harassing the same person over and over with no end to it)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Don't be the reason someone logs off or doesn't log in. Treat others the way you would want to be treated.</p>

                    <h4>🏥 Green Zones</h4>
                    <p><strong>Governmental Hospitals, Police stations, and City Hall</strong> are safe zones. No crime or hostile RP is allowed inside these venues.</p>
                    <p>Hospitals, hairdressers, tattoo shops, and clothing stores are also protected because people are in menu interactions and have no way of defending themselves, leaving them at a complete disadvantage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Do not hospital camp</strong> - meaning if you injure someone, you cannot wait outside the hospital to attack them again.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hairdressers, tattoo shops, and clothing stores</strong> have menu interactions where players have no way of defending themselves. Please keep this in mind when you are wanting to hold someone up at these places.</p>
                    <p><strong>No taking a person hostage</strong> when they are clearly in an active job that depends on them having to finish the job in order to get paid (vehicles will despawn and they will not be able to finish their job).</p>

                    <li>Using Discord info unless it's posted in an IC channel</li>
                    <li>Watching or lurking live streams while logged in on the server</li>
                    <li>Using player IDs to identify someone unless you're reporting them</li>
                    <li>Do not use player nametags, voice identifiers, or OOC knowledge to identify characters</li>
                    <li>Information learned on one character cannot be used on another character</li>
                    <li><strong>Changelogs:</strong> Don't use changelogs to act on new features IC. Discover things organically through roleplay. If PDM is adding cars, wait for their announcement—don't rush in just because you saw it in the logs.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>🗣️ Voice ID & Appearance</h4>
                    <p>You can't identify someone just by their voice, hair, or outfit unless they're wearing the exact same clothes. Don't assume it's the same person without solid IC evidence.</p>
                    <p><strong>For people committing crimes:</strong> Please make an effort to disguise yourself. Try altering or lowering the pitch of your voice and actually make the effort to get a good disguise on.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Do not force actions or scenarios onto other players without giving them a chance to respond. For Torture RP and ERP, it must be consensual</li>
                    <li>Do not abuse game mechanics to gain unfair advantages</li>

                    <h2>Quick Tips for Staying in Character</h2>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Your phone is basic</strong> - You can call and text, that's about it. No apps, no internet browsing worth mentioning</li>
                        <li><strong>Making plans is harder</strong> - You can't just check someone's location or send a quick message. You have to actually call or meet up</li>
                        <li><strong>Information isn't instant</strong> - Google existed but wasn't as comprehensive. You might actually not know something immediately</li>
                        <li><strong>Social media is new and clunky</strong> - MyFace (MySpace) is about customizing your profile with glittery backgrounds and choosing your Top 8</li>
                        <li><strong>Music is physical</strong> - You burn CDs, you carry a CD case in your car, you buy albums</li>
                        <li><strong>Photos are special</strong> - You can't take 100 photos and delete 99. Digital cameras have limited storage</li>
                        <li><strong>TV shows matter</strong> - No streaming means you actually had to watch shows when they aired or record them on VHS/DVR</li>
                    </ol>
